# 🧠 blakusnaku — Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my **analytics portfolio hub**, where I document, visualize, and showcase my ongoing journey from **data cleaning to full-stack analytics**.

This portfolio connects my two active projects — the **Study Dashboard** and **100 Days of Data** — and highlights my progress in building real analytics workflows across Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.

### 📅 [100 Days of Data](https://github.com/blakusnaku/blakusnaku-100-days-of-data)
My structured 100-day challenge where I practice and document one concept per day across the full data stack — from **SQL joins** to **Power BI dashboards**.  
**Tech stack:** SQL, Python (pandas), Power BI  
**Highlights:**
- 🔍 Daily block structure (Block 1–4 learning flow)  
- 🧠 SQL drills & pandas replications  
- ⚙️ Power BI dashboards linked to Python outputs  
- ✍️ Daily README logs with reflections

## 🧮 Gallery Snapshots
Curated visuals and insights from my ongoing projects.  
*(Coming soon — will feature SQL joins, Power BI dashboards, and study dashboard metrics.)*

## 🧠 My Learning Philosophy
I believe in **building data intuition through iteration** — every dataset is a new story to clean, model, and visualize.  
Through consistent 100-day sprints and dashboard versioning, I aim to master the pipeline from **raw data → clean insights → interactive dashboards.**
